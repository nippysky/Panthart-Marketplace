# Panthart

Panthart is a modern NFT platform for creators and collectors. It lets you deploy collections, mint single pieces, and trade them in a smooth, social, data-aware experience.

## What it is

- **Creator-first minting** — Launch ERC-721 drops (collections) or single-piece NFTs (ERC-721/1155) with royalty snapshots.
- **Built-in marketplace** — List items at a fixed price or run auctions; activity is tracked so every NFT has a clear history.
- **Rich profiles** — Public profile pages with your NFTs, social links, and collection stats.
- **Fast, index-aware UI** — The app keeps collections in sync with the chain and progressively shows items as they index.

## Why it exists

NFT tooling is either too barebones or too bloated. Panthart aims to be the middle ground—simple enough to use daily, powerful enough for real drops.
